In this repository, I'll start a project to show how to build a Python library
There are several Python libraries that can be used for working with tables, including:

1.Pandas: a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis, which includes functions for reading and writing tables in various formats, cleaning and transforming data, and performing calculations and statistical analyses.

2.OpenPyXL: a library for working with Excel files, which includes functions for creating, reading, and editing tables in Excel spreadsheets.

3.Tabula: a library for extracting tables from PDF documents, which can be useful for processing data from research papers, reports, and other sources.

4.Beautiful Soup: a library for parsing HTML and XML documents, which can be used to extract data from tables embedded in web pages.

To automate table processing with Python, you will typically need to:

1.Read in the table data using one of the libraries above.

2.Clean and transform the data as needed, for example by removing empty cells, replacing missing values, or converting data types.

3.Perform any desired calculations or statistical analyses on the data.

4.Write the processed data back to a table format, such as a CSV or Excel file, or display the results in a formatted table.

Here's an example of how you might use Pandas to read in a CSV file containing a table of data, clean and transform the data, and write the processed data back to a new CSV file:
# import pandas
import pandas as pd
# Read in the table data from a CSV file
table_data = pd.read_csv('my_table_data.csv')
# Clean and transform the data as needed
table_data = table_data.dropna() # remove rows with missing values
# remove dollar sign from price column
table_data['price'] = table_data['price'].str.replace('$', '') 
# convert price column to float data type
table_data['price'] = table_data['price'].astype(float) 
# Perform calculations or statistical analyses on the data
mean_price = table_data['price'].mean()
# Write the processed data back to a new CSV file
table_data.to_csv('my_processed_table_data.csv', index=False)
